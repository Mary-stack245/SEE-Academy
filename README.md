# SEE-Academy

SEE-Academy is an academic project designed to support software engineering education by providing tools and resources to help students and educators engage in effective software development and collaboration using GitHub.

## Overview

This project aims to facilitate hands-on learning in software engineering by integrating practical activities based on real-world software development workflows. It encourages students to adopt best practices for version control, project management, and software lifecycle documentation while interacting with GitHub repositories.

## Features

- Repository analysis tools for inspecting project health and progress.
- Support for documenting phases of the software development lifecycle.
- Integration with GitHub workflows to foster collaborative development.
- Educational resources and templates to guide student contributions.
- Encourages Agile methodologies such as Scrum for iterative development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally and contribute effectively:

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/Mary-stack245/SEE-Academy.git

text

2. **Explore the project structure:**  
Review folders and files to understand how coding files, documents, and resources are organized.

3. **Follow project guidelines:**  
Adhere to the provided documentation standards and branching model to maintain consistency.

4. **Use GitHub features:**  
Utilize pull requests, issues, and project boards to collaborate and track progress.
